Hi, I'm Knockturn 👋
🚀 Fullstack Developer Extraordinaire
I’m a digital architect who builds the bridge while running across it. I specialize in the "Fullstack Sandwich"—layering complex logic between layers of beautiful UI, with a healthy spread of "how did this even work?" in the middle.

The Professional Rundown:

Frontend: I spend 40% of my time coding and 60% of my time fighting a single CSS margin that refuses to move.

Backend: I speak fluent C#. I spend my days whispering sweet nothings to the .NET compiler and convincing NullReferenceExceptions that we can still be friends.

Architecture: I build systems so robust they can survive everything except a user who knows what they're doing.

My Philosophy: I believe code should be like a good joke: if you have to explain it, it’s probably bad. I write clean code, commit frequently, and only cry during major version migrations.

"I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Because I live on the edge, and the edge is where the 'Extraordinaire' happens."
